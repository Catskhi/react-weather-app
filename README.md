## About the project
This is a small project I did to test some types of concepts and features of technologies. It's a weather app, in it, you can search for a location in the search bar and the app will return to you information such as the percentage of humidity of the location, the temperature and wind speed based on the metric system. 

I learned a lot with this project, especially the CSS animations, which I've never paid much attention before, and learned better ways to fetch an API and consolidate the knowledge of the useEffect hook.

You can view the site here: https://catskhi-react-weather-app.vercel.app/. But, if you want to run it on your local machine, see the instructions below.
